INEXCUSABLE AF 🚫😤!\n\nLOCKDOWN? COULD'VE BEEN SKIPPED 🚫🔒 if they rolled out SOCIAL DISTANCING 👯‍♂️🚫 and HOUSEHOLD ISOLATION 🏠🚪 EARLIER than mid-MARCH 2020 📅. But ministers SNOOZED 😴 so hard, by action time it was INEVITABLE 💥 – modelling says WEEK EARLIER on 16 MARCH 🗓️ would've SAVED 23K LIVES IN ENGLAND 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💀, that's 48% FEWER DEATHS IN WAVE 1 🌊☠️! Total pandemic toll? 227K UK DEAD 😢🪦 by 2023, but early lock would've been a MAYBE – too many variables like VARIED VAX ROLLOUTS 💉🎲!\n\nGOV CULTURE? TOXIC CHAOS 🤡💨 at 10 DOWNING STREET 🏛️ – Dominic CUMMINGS 👁️🚗 the DESTABILISING DADDY 😈, his BARNARD CASTLE EYE TEST 👀😂 poisoned the vibe with FEAR, SUSPICION & DISTRUST ☠️😱! Boris BOZO 🎪🐽 too OPTIMISTIC 🌈🤪, 'OSCILLATING' on lockdowns like a drunk pendulum 🥴⏰, failed to LEAD like PM DADDY 👑 – thought it'd be 'NOTHINGBURGER' 🍔🚫!

POOR KIDDOS 😢🏫 not prioritised, schools shut = MASSIVE HARM for MOST (not high-risk) – NO NATION ready for HOMESCHOOL ZOOM HELL 📱😩! RULE-BREAKERS like CUMMINGS' DURHAM DASH 🚗🏃‍♂️, Scot CMO Calderwood's SECOND HOME SNEAK 👻🏠, Prof Ferguson's LOCKDOWN LOVER VISITS 💋🚫, then DOWNING ST PARTIES 🥂🎉 in 2021? PUBLIC OUTCRY 😡📣! Boris & Rishi SUNAK 💰 got FINED 😠💸 like naughty schoolboys!\n\nFOUR NATIONS DRAGGED 👴👵👦👧 – NO TRUST between Boris & devolved bosses 🤝🚫, early on TOO RELIANT on UK LEAD (which SUCKED 😩), later SCOTLAND 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 SLAYED with LOCAL LOCKS 🔒📍 avoiding NATIONAL ONE, Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 had HIGHEST DEATH RATE ☠️📈 Aug-Dec, NI CHAOTIC 🤪💥, England travel FREE-FOR-ALL undermined caution 🚗🆓!\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS GALORE 📜💡 – gov MUST respond, or future pandemics gonna ROAST 'em 🔥😈!
